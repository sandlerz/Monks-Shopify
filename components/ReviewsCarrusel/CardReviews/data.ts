    review:
      'Honestly, finding a natural deodorant that doesn’t have coconut oil in it is all but impossible, but then also finding a natural that doesn’t have coconut oil AND doesn’t stain my clothes or feel like glue seemed like too big of an ask. Monks deodorant checks all the boxes and smells LOVELY. I love it. The Vetiver smells great, too. Amazing!',

    review:
      'To be honest I was unsure about the spray feature in a deodorant but because this one is all natural I´m enjoying it. Sometimes I´ll even spray it on my clothes because the Yuzu scent is lovely. As a guy that works out 5 days a week this deodorant is working on overtime! Happy a buddy of mine recommended it.',

    review:
      'I just tried this for this first time and it’s exceeded my expectations. Smell is great, which is really important to me. I love that it goes well with the various cologne I wear. I don’t know that I had high hopes for sweat because I tend to be a very sweaty person. However, I’m happy to report that so far, I’ve been dry. Unlike most deodorants, I can tell this isn’t just masking the odor. You could put your nose straight up into my arm pit without any reason for concern. Good stuff Read Less',

    title: 'Convenient and fresh!',
    review:
      'I really enjoy this product and appreciate the convenience and easy of spraying the deodorant on rather than a roller deodorant. I have armpit hair and roller deodorant would always pull my hair out. I do not have to deal with that at all with this product! I also know it won´t leave a residue on my clothes or clump. It has a very fresh scent!',
